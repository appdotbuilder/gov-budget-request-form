  // 1. Check if the file upload exists and the parent budget request is editable
  // 2. Delete the physical file from storage
  // 3. Delete the file upload record from the database
  // 4. Return true if deletion was successful, false otherwise
  // 5. Handle cases where the file doesn't exist or cannot be deleted
  // 6. Cleanup database records even if file deletion fails
