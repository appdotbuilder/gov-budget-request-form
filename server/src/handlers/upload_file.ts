  // 1. Validate the input data and file constraints (size, type, etc.)
  // 2. Check if the associated budget request exists and is editable
  // 3. Store the file in the filesystem or cloud storage
  // 4. Insert the file upload record into the database
  // 5. Return the created file upload record with generated ID and timestamps
  // 6. Handle file upload errors and cleanup on failure
